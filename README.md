This is a competitive programming team called strangers

## Repository Structure
- Root of the repository you can see many directories like books, beginners, mathematics, strings, graphs etc.
- Each of these directories have 3 sub directories. easy, medium and hard.
- Inside each directory you will find a directory which represents the problem name
- Inside the problem directory you will find a README.md file where we will instruct you how to solve the problem. Steps for solving the problem.
- And this same directory you will find a lot of files. Where every competitive programmers submitted their code.
- Others directories like medium and hard is 100% same as easy directory structure.

## Rules
- We will provide a task per day.
- You need to submit your task within 24 hours.
- If you are inactive for 3 days then you will be disqualified for some days.
- If you can't solve the task then try again and again.
- If you failed a lot of time then open the problems directory and see how other members solved this.
- After all of those process if you can't understand the steps then we will arrange a google meet.
- Whenever you upload a file you need to follow this structure
  
  - `<last 3 digits of your student id>.<your github username>.<probelm name using camel case format with file extension>`
  - `063.mdmarufsarker.helloWorld.cpp`
